# Resume
Hi! This is a simple repo just so I can store the source Latex code for my resume.

This resume is compiled with Xelatex. It can be downloaded by entering <code>sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex</code>

You can find the PDF version [here](https://tomvarano.com/resume) or you can clone and compile it yourself by running `./compile.sh <your desired resume file>` in the command prompt. The output will be saved to the proper correspoinding directory in <code>./output/</code>. <code>varano-resume.tex</code> is my main programming resume.
